The buildings of the campus are designed to be energy-efficient with insulation. A Building Management System (BMS) has been installed to optimise the use of air conditioning. The use of energy saving lighting systems and non-conventional energy through solar hot water systems and Solar photo-voltaic system has been installed to reduce power consumption and augment the grid supplied electric energy.
The entire waste water generated in the campus is recycled using 2 sewage treatment plants with a capacity of 65 KL per day, and water so generated is used for horticulture, flushing and air-conditioning works. A garbage segregation scheme for productive and safe disposal of solid waste has been worked out with a local NGO.
