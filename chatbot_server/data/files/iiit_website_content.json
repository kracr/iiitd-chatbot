Therefore it does not tolerate any form of academic dishonesty. Almost all violations of academic honesty in course submissions (homework assignments, project reports) are instances of plagiarism. Details about plagiarism, how to avoid it and its consequences are described in a document available <strong><a href=\"../../sites/default/files/docs/education/2017/Plagiarism Policy - Updated.pdf\">here</a></strong>. A brief summary of this document is given below.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color:#3fada8;\"><strong>Plagiarism is the offence of taking undue credit for someone else\u2019s work.</strong></span></h4>\n<p>When you submit an assignment, the instructor basically wants to evaluate/ grade you on what you did. And unless you explicitly indicate that some part is not done by you, it is implicitly assumed that the entire assignment was done by you. Academic dishonesty is displayed when some part(s) of your assignment are someone else\u2019s writing/ idea/ art (for example a friend, a solution manual, a website), but you claim it as your own by not explicitly making it clear that these parts are someone else's.</p>\n<p>If, for whatever reason, you have to use some existing work, you cannot copy - you can only borrow (when you borrow, you do not claim ownership of the borrowed item). Therefore, it is your responsibility to explicitly indicate which parts are borrowed. You are allowed to borrow definitions, formulae, figures, one sentence, etc. by (1) attributing it to the original source AND (2) making it absolutely clear that the copied part is not your own (you need to do both).</p>\n<p>Most of the times, students are led to academic dishonesty simply because their solution ended up unnecessarily containing a significant amount of non-original work. An easy way to avoid this is to ensure that the sources are not in front of you \u2013 if it was a book, do not have it open in front of you, if it was a website, then do not have it on screen. Do not memorise what you have read - unlike practices in school, we do not encourage memorisation by heart. And this is what is needed from you in all your homeworks \u2013 explain whatever you want in your own words based on your own understanding. If you are discussing a homework assignment with others (make sure the instructor has allowed it in that particular course), you can avoid dishonesty by (1) if you have seen your friend\u2019s homework, ensure that it is not open in front of you when you do your own (2) mentioning your collaborators in your submission.</p>\n<p>Nick Morris describes the four major types of plagiarism as follows below. The following excerpt is taken from his webpage, with his kind permission.</p>\n<ol><li>\u2018Text\u2019 - copying text from a book, paper, document etc.</li>\n<li>\u2018Diagrams &amp; Program\u2019 - copying a diagram or a program</li>\n<li>\u2018Idea\u2019 - passing off another person\u2019s idea as your own</li>\n<li>\u2018Auto\u2019 - copying from yourself!</li>\n</ol><p><strong>Text Plagiarism:</strong> This is the most easy to understand, and the most common form of plagiarism. Basically it is the copying of text from some source (a paper, text book, fellow student, internet) into your own work, and then passing it off as your own. It should be noted that adding a reference (i.e. stating from where you copied the text) is no 'protection' and doesn't mean you can copy (unless it has been explicitly allowed). If you find yourself reaching for the copy and paste keys on the computer then there is a good chance it will be plagiarism.</p>\n<p><strong>Diagram &amp; Code Plagiarism:</strong> This is where you copy a diagram, figure or a chunk of code from somewhere else and pass it off as your own (this can also be viewed as 'idea' plagiarism as some one has thought long and hard about creating the figure or code). Note that, straightforward modifications to the original figure or code is still considered plagiarism.</p>\n<p><strong>Idea Plagiarism:</strong> This is the worst form of plagiarism as you would be attempting to pass off the hard work, and intellectual property, of a fellow person as your own. You can write about the ideas and thoughts of others, but YOU MUST STATE FROM WHERE YOU GOT THE IDEA. Basically, this is one of the reasons why we reference sources of information, you are stating who had the original idea, and how they came by it. Effectively by referencing you are acknowledging the hard work of the others.</p>\n<p><strong>Auto-Plagiarism:</strong> This form of plagiarism is the one most people have difficulty understanding. After all, how can you plagiarise yourself? You 'own' the work and the intellectual property! Well, basically auto-plagiarism would occur if you handed in the same piece of work for two different assignments and got two lots of marks for it. Or put another way, it is like making one burger in McDonald's and selling it twice.<br/>\nRead the <a href=\"../../sites/default/files/docs/education/2017/Plagiarism Policy - Updated.pdf\">academic dishonesty policy</a> for complete information. Some courses may have its own policy, so read and understand policies for individual courses or ask the course instructor for clarifications in case of doubt.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color:#3fada8;\"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions about Plagiarism</strong></span></h4>\n<ol><li><strong>Is it okay if I am not submitting verbatim copy, but (1) modify few phrases here and there (2) rewrite some of the sentences (3) modify the solution sentence by sentence (4) copy only a small part (5) for programs, change variable names and function names?</strong><br/>\n\tAll of the above constitute plagiarism even though you are not really submitting a verbatim copy of someone else\u2019s work. It is clear in all of the above cases that none of the submitted solutions are your own yet by submitting them, you claim them to be your solution - this is obviously plagiarism.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>I copied (i.e. verbatim) just the introduction, and also gave reference to the paper from where I copied.</strong><br/>\n\tThis is not allowed \u2013 you can borrow verbatim only one/ two sentences, that too by quoting. Anything more, you have to say in your own words.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>By \"copy\u201d, do you mean \u201ccopy-and-paste\u201d operation?</strong><br/>\n\tYou got to be kidding! Here \u201ccopy\u201d refers to any kind of similar items and copying means anything that creates something which is similar to the original. Copying could be done manually, or using tools, or computer based \u2026 if you are in doubt, first clarify with the instructor. Also, remember that physical similarity is NOT the only basis behind a copy, similarity in idea, style \u2026 all of these mean a copy.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Is it okay if I submit (1) a modified form of existing solution (2) existing solution which is paraphrased/ quoted properly (3) my own writing based on someone else\u2019s idea (4) someone else\u2019s program with my modifications AND I give proper reference to the source in all the cases.</strong>\u00a0<br/>\n\tYou may not be charged with plagiarism if you make it clear what is your work. But note that, the instructor may give you zero, if your solution ends up containing only borrowed material.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>I mugged up an entire solution from obtained via solution manual, the internet, some friend, some other book and then wrote it down. Is this prohibited?</strong><br/>\n\tYes, this is plagiarism. Mugging up the solution is same as writing it keeping having the source open in front of you. It goes against the spirit of you understanding the solution and be able to express it in your own words - basically, you are copying the solution idea.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Can I copy from lecture notes? From text-books? From papers part of the curriculum of a \u00a0paper-reading course?</strong><br/>\n\tNo. Unless explicitly allowed, you can not copy verbatim from textbook or lecture notes or other instruction material. Anyway, it is unlikely in IIIT-Delhi that you will be asked questions in any homework/report whose answers appear verbatim in text. However, you can use the ideas given in such instructional material without any restriction. Some courses may require you to give precise answers (e.g., definitions) as given in the book or lecture notes; please clarify with the instructor if you are allowed to copy in such cases.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Do I have to cite everytime I use \u201cQuicksort\u201d in my homework?</strong><br/>\n\tNo. You are allowed to freely use/ refer concepts/ ideas covered in the instructional material (the textbook, lecture notes, slides, your notes) - in fact, you are encouraged to do so. But you still may not copy any text/ example/ figure verbatim (unless explicitly allowed to do so).<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Are these instances of plagiarism?</strong><br/><strong><em>Scenario:</em></strong> I used a theorem given in the textbook in my homework solution. This is NOT plagiarism because you can freely use ideas/ results in instruction material without restriction.<br/><strong><em>Scenario:</em></strong> I used a theorem which I found on a website in my proof, which I did not cite. This is plagiarism if you didn\u2019t cite the source. Without citation, and since the theorem is not in the book, it will appear as if you should be given credit for the theorem.<br/><strong><em>Scenario:</em></strong> I used a theorem which I found on a website in my proof, and I also cited the website. If the course allowed referring to the internet, then this is not plagiarism.<br/><em><strong>Scenario:</strong></em> The question in the homework is similar a solved question given in the book. So I copied (verbatim) most of its solution from the book. You are not allowed to verbatim copy from the textbook. This IS plagiarism since you are claiming credit for the solution which was in fact given by the authors of the book.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Is it plagiarism to take external help to do homework, e.g., can I discuss with my classmates, can I search on the internet? Can I do XYZ?</strong><br/>\n\tThere could be course specific policies prohibiting any of these, but as such external help taken to increase understanding of the homework/ paper/ project does not constitute plagiarism. However, borrowing solution idea from the internet, or from a classmate, is plagiarism unless explicitly allowed.<br/>\n\tGenerally, in most courses in IIIT-Delhi, discussion with fellow students in the same course is allowed (unless explicitly disallowed), but copying from someone else\u2019s assignment is never allowed. Similarly, you may be allowed to look on the internet, or consult a reference book, to understand relevant topics required to do the homework/ report/ project, but using text/ code/ idea from these sources is not allowed. Since specific instructors might prohibit specific actions as per course policy - if you have doubt always ask the instructor.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>I discussed my homework with my senior, or with some other person not in my class, or on some online forum.</strong><br/>\n\tThis is usually not allowed in IIIT-Delhi and may be counted as plagiarism. Other than the instructor and the TAs, usually you can only discuss with your classmates. Also, if you discuss with your classmates, you have to specify their names as collaborators.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>I was accused of plagiarism in my programming assignment/ project. But I had changed all variable names, all function names and cleaned up the solution. Is this still plagiarism? What if I started by copying a sample program, and then added \u201call\u201d the required functionality to create my final project?</strong><br/>\n\tThe first case is clearly plagiarism. The program you submitted is essentially someone else\u2019s work. Claiming it to be yours is plagiarism. In the second case, if you added \u201call\u201d the functionality required by the homework, then it may not be a case of plagiarism - however, to be on the safe side, you should not attempt this without explicit consent of your instructor.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>In our schools/ colleges we are often encouraged to write answers as close as possible to what is given in the book. Why is it not allowed here?</strong><br/>\n\tIn most of our assignments, you are unlikely to find questions of the type \u201cdescribe xxx\u201d which can be found in the textbook. But if you do, as described above, it is better for you to write in your own words to avoid the risk of getting zero.<br/>\n\tThis is quite different from the school system where you were encouraged to report verbatim what was taught in the class or given in the book. In the school system, homework are meant to be preparation for board-level exams, in which exact answers are preferred to maintain consistency and to evaluate knowledge. This is very different from the scenario at IIIT-Delhi - here homeworks are often evaluated for understanding.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>I did not intend to cheat. I had no idea &lt;something&gt; is not cheating. I have a doubt if &lt;something&gt; is cheating.</strong><br/>\n\tYou are responsible for writing your own solution. It is your responsibility to ensure that your action is not breaking any rule, no matter what your actual intentions are. If in doubt, always clarify with the respective instructor/ official. If there is lack of time or scope in getting in touch with them, take the safest path.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>I cheated \u00a0in two different homework. \u00a0The two homework had been evaluated together - does this count as one cheating or as repeated cheating?</strong><br/>\n\tIt is a repeated cheating since when you submitted the second homework you knew that you had already cheated once.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Even though I have copied someone else\u2019s solution, I actually understand the solution.</strong><br/>\n\tIt does not matter - you are still guilty of plagiarism - the solution you are claiming credit for was prepared by someone other than you. In fact, in such case you should have written the solution in your own words. If you submitted a copied version, the instructor has no way to know if you actually understood the solution.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Do the same rules apply to an instructor of a course for the material he/ she uses in the course?</strong><br/>\n\tNo. The instructor of a course is assumed and expected to use existing material. By rule, teaching does not require inventing new material, and almost always involves existing material - in terms of ideas/ content/ explanation. A teacher is never assumed, explicitly or implicitly, to use anything of his own. On the other hand, when a teacher \"submits\" a proposal/ paper, writes a book, gives a talk, the exact same rules of homework submission also applies to him/ her. For example, when a faculty member makes a presentation in a conference - there it is assumed that the material/ slides are his/ her own - in these presentations, presenters will generally cite the source, if they take some slide from somewhere.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>I copied without citing and when caught, I accepted my \u201cmistake\u201d. What will happen?</strong><br/>\n\tOnce found guilty of plagiarism, institute policies will be applicable even if you accept it later.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Is copying from Wikipedia allowed?</strong><br/>\n\tNot without citation, and that also only when referring to internet/Wikipedia is allowed in your course. Please refer to the Wikipedia copyright policy.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>I am facing a new situation. How do I know if &lt;something&gt; would be plagiarism?</strong><br/>\n\tThe rule of thumb is: if there is anything in the submission which you borrowed from somewhere else, then you should make it explicit what is borrowed and from where.<br/>\n\tHowever, for specific cases, you should always clarify with the instructor.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Do I have to cite all sources of an idea/ text/ proof?</strong><br/>\n\tNo - you only need to cite one source for each part of borrowed material.<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Why is the punishment so harsh for plagiarism compared to other simple mistakes? Why isn\u2019t it sufficient to award a zero in the corresponding HW?</strong><br/>\n\tPlagiarism is a serious offence, much more than a simple mistake. Plagiarism - taking false credit - is an issue of ethics and is actually a serious offence in academics - similar to copyright violation in civil laws. That\u2019s why the punishment goes beyond giving zero in the respective HW. On the other hand, a student my quote/ cite as per rule all throughout and be not guilty of plagiarism. But he may still get zero since his whole answer or just contains citation/ paraphrasing and he showed no understanding which was required. or maybe because he borrowed the main idea of the proof (even though be cited).<br/>\n\t\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>If I am only copying part of the solution, I am making an honest effort to solve it and I also understand the solution. Since I am learning in the end, why is this not allowed? Why is the institute trying to constrain our sources of studying?</strong><br/>\n\tThe objective of these rules is not to ensure whether students are learning or by how much - learning is evaluated by the instructor using separate means.<br/>\n\tPlagiarism - taking false credit - is an issue of ethics and is actually a serious offence in academics - similar to copyright violation in civil laws. Academic plagiarism is a big problem worldwide, and is rising in India due to lack of proper awareness. We want to maintain the integrity of the academic environment of the institute, and would like to see our students follow the same standard of academic integrity as followed by us and by others in the rest of the world.

The decision whether the degree is to be pursued for skill and knowledge up-gradation, or also for building research skills should rest with the student. The Institute also believes that a student should be given an option of pursuing M.Tech without assistantship so he/she can focus full time on the program, and possibly finish the program sooner, as compared to a student who is on Assistantship and so has to do part-time work in lieu of the assistantship.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The Institute feels that to address the needs of the industry, which today requires more specialized manpower as each field is getting more complex, it is desirable to provide specializations within CSE and ECE in the M.Tech program.

A tenure-track faculty is expected to engage heavily in research and teaching. The eligibility criteria for tenure-track faculty positions are similar as in IITs.\u00a0 <strong><em>For an Assistant Professor position, a candidate must have a PhD</em></strong>\u00a0 plus three years experience. However, for PhDs from a well known University/Institute (e.g. IITs/IISc/TIFR/ISI/... in India or well known research universities across the world), and a good research/academic record, the 3 years experience requirement may be waived.</p>\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">The pay scale for faculty is same as in IITs. In addition, extra\u00a0personal pay may be provided. All regular faculty will be provided on-campus or leased accommodation. Other benefits include initiation research grant, travel support, professional development fund, etc., and personal benefits such as health insurance, LTC, contribution to pension plan, etc.</p>\n<p class=\"rtejustify\">IIIT-Delhi follows a tenure model in which an initial contract is given for 5/7 years. Before completion of initial contract, an extensive evaluation of performance of Research &amp; Teaching is done. If the faculty member\u2019s performance is good, he/she can expect to get promoted and tenured.\u00a0</p>\n<!--Some insights on <a href=\"https://jalote.wordpress.com/2015/06/14/assessing-a-faculty-candidate/\">how assessment for faculty positions is done is discussed in this blog article</a> of the Director. --><p class=\"rtejustify\">The overall selection process is given below.

We are proud to have about 17% female students in our undergraduate program, and over 46% in our PG programs - which we believe is the highest in India in Technical Institutions. About 11% of our faculty is also female - while not as high as the Institute desires, it is better than most technical institutions. Almost 37% of our admin officers are women.</p>\n<p class=\"rtejustify\"><strong>Senior Level Positions.</strong> At senior levels, IIIT-Delhi hopes to attract a selected few who have well established global reputation in research and development and who can take leadership for new centers, programs, etc. Applications are particularly invited from senior researchers who are looking for a suitable opportunity to establish a center in India in some specialized area, particularly interdisciplinary areas.</p>\n<p class=\"rtejustify\"><strong>Visiting\u00a0Positions and Sabbaticals.</strong>\u00a0IIIT-Delhi's faculty are engaged in over 30 collaborations with various academic institutions\u00a0and research labs across the world. The institute will like to host visitors on their Sabbatical or other programs, like the <a href=\"http://dst.gov.in/vajra\">Vajra scheme</a>. If you are interested in establishing some collaboration, please contact the faculty member you may want to work with or the Director. Senior people who are willing to spend 2 or more years and take up some leadership / administrative position are also invited to contact.</p>\n<p class=\"rtejustify\"><strong>Teaching-Track Positions.\u00a0</strong>To promote excellence in teaching, IIIT-Delhi has created a few teaching-track faculty positions, which are primarily targeted towards attracting outstanding teachers into the Institute, and to whom both students and faculty may look up as role-models for teaching. Teaching-track faculty members are regular faculty members in the Institute but with a different emphasis between teaching and research. They will have a higher teaching load and will be expected to engage in high quality teaching, and accordingly, will be expected to have a modest level of engagement in research. The criterion for tenure and promotion also has a higher expectation in quality teaching than research. Minimum qualifications for a teaching-track Assistant Professor is same as mentioned above. However suitable candidates with MTech/MS/ Equivalent\u00a0and at least 5 years experience are also eligible, if their teaching record and reputation is outstanding.</p>\n<p class=\"rtejustify\"><strong>A candidate can apply anytime as faculty applications are processed regularly.
