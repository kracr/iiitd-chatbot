Ensure that you learn these well and do the assignments and projects in these courses. Those who want to be in analytics of any kinds should note that while PS does not form a pre - requisite to many courses, its understanding is very important for such jobs. Select electives that strengthen your ability for problem solving and make you learn new techniques and technologies and apply them. So, courses with programming assignments and/or projects are helpful including \u201cconceptual\u201d courses like advanced algorithms, optimization, etc.). In addition, ECE students should try to participate in labs/engineering design/ hardware design related projects to have a good hands-on experience. Instead of a minimum of two electives per semester, do three CSE/ECE/Mathematics/DES/SS electives(applicable to your respective branch) in your 3 and 4 years. Doan IP and BTP in engineering category. Do an internship in which you are required to build systems, develop applications, etc. This will strengthen your capabilities, as well as provide an opportunity to learn new things.

In College life, besides studies, is also an important goal for students. Therefore they need to effectively balance the two goals, which often conflict. In this pursuit, effective study habits can be very useful. They can help to learn effectively and efficiently, thus leaving sufficient time for other activities in life without compromising your academics. However, we have realized that many students are not clear on how to study effectively.", "121": "There is literature on this subject available\u2014 indeed there is a full book on it (multiple copies of which are in IIIT-D library). However, students often think these are too idealized or impractical, or that they do not apply to their environment or situation.", "122": "To better understand what works well in an environment like that of IIITDelhi, one of our graduating students (Digvijay Singh) interacted with a set of students from his batch who were known to have good understanding of various subjects, who we will refer to as effective students (this set of students we determined not by grades but by their performance in interviews and exams conducted by best companies that visited us and general input from faculty and students about their understanding, knowledge, skills). We further validated the outcome of this study by interacting with a set of students from the current batch who have been doing well. It should be noted that not all of them are in the high CGPA category\u2014 many of them are below 8.0. It should be pointed out that this is nota statistically and scientifically rigorous study. Also, the habits mentioned here are the common ones, which most effective students we talked to followed. It does not mean that these are the only methods. However, | believe if these practices are sound and if students follow these, they can expect to be effective in their learning.", "123": "The three main effective study practices that emerged are:", "124": "Attending lectures regularly and taking notes in them, even if the lectures are not very exciting/ engaging, is a practice most effective students followed. This makes sense, students who do not follow this in the hope that they will \u201cmake up\u201d for the lectures they miss, generally do not end up \u201cmaking up\u201d, and soon find themselves lost with too much to catch up. And missing lectures can easily become a habit, which is clearly to be avoided.", "125": "The two aspects of this practice are:", "126": "Attend the lectures. Make notes in the lectures\u2014 not copy what the faculty is writing, but making notes in your own language. The second point is important\u2014 copying from the board/slide is a passive act which does not help in learning, but making notes in your own words is an active learning task, which engages the student and helps in learning. Paying attention in lectures actually helps save time\u2014a student is likely to take much more time to understand and learn the topic by him/herself, if he/she does not attend the lecture, or is inattentive.", "127": "Do the assignments yourself\u2014- most effective students did most of the assignments themselves, even if it took them more time or even if they were not able to complete in time. While lectures introduce the topics and concepts, the real learning and skill building of a student happens during assignments\u2014 this is where the students practices and tries to apply the concept/method. So, without doing assignments yourself, there can be really no learning. It should be noticed that taking help (not copying) from friends in assignments is fine, particularly when one is stuck. Indeed taking and giving help in the form of discussions, explanations, guiding is a good way of learning.", "128": "All effective students have some method of ensuring that they have revised the material covered in the previous week or so, and that they prepared for the next week\u2019s lectures and work. This practice | am calling weekly sync-up (even though students might be practicing this over somewhat longer periods.) Some revise regularly, some do revision with the assignment, some during the weekends, etc., but one common theme is that they sync-up regularly and ensure that they are not behind or lost, as they realize that if they continue while being lost, they will not recover.(One student said that if he could not follow two lectures well, it was a big warning sign and he would put extra work to catch up). This practice ensures that even if they missed a lecture/assignment, they make up for it and do not fall behind. Without this practice, there is a real risk that a student can fall behind so much that it will be very hard to catch up. Ina semester of 4 months with a student doing 5 courses, one simply can\u2019t really afford to fall behind too much! This can be viewed as the LAW for effective studying. Follow the LAW, with suitable enhancements/ modifications to suit your style, and the chances are that you will become an effective learner, and derive the benefits that come from that.", "129": "There are some other practices which some effective students also used:", "130": "When there are many tasks from multiple courses, as well as from other activities, there will clashing deadlines. Prioritising will clearly be important in such a situation to achieve the most in the limited time. As one student said: \u201cIn such a scenario, life becomes a lot easier when you manually set down targets to be achieved by what deadline (which may be before/same day as your submission deadlines). Use sticky notes as gentle reminders to yourself so you can use your time wisely when brunt of work is more.\u201d  Group and Individual Projects  As said by one student: \u201cWhile it is good to do projects in team to learn teamwork and leadership qualities, | used to push myself and sometimes go forth with individual projects. Undoubtedly, it takes more effort and time, but it boosted my confidence in my own abilities to handle projects single-handedly and made me more self-reliant and self-sufficient.\u201d    Group Study Many prefer individual study  Take help from friends for understanding  Most students indicated that face-to-face discussion with friends was the first and most common approach they used for clarifying doubts/material. If this did not work then they will go to discuss it on forums, instructor.", "131": "Explain to them as explaining helps them understand better (my note: by discussing/clarifying you are helping your friend, but by providing your assignment to your friends for copying you are actually hurting them as you are discouraging them to learn, besides taking them the slippery slope of using unfair means)  Take help from friends for understanding  Most students indicated that face-to-face discussion with friends was the first and most common approach they used for clarifying doubts/material. If this did not work then they will go to discuss it on forums, instructor.", "132": "This is more a value statement but was commonly echoed by most of the students. While they all engaged in other activities (most of them are quite active in clubs, events, etc., they are clear that academics get the highest priority.)  Besides these practices, there is one attitude/trait | would like to highlight, which | have seen in many students who have done well in whatever they do after college education\u2014 and that is curiosity and initiative to go beyond the courses. Many effective students engage in some technical activities that they do which are not needed for their courses-\u2014 i.e. they take the initiative to go beyond the courses. Examples of these initiatives can be: participating in competitive programming, participating in technical clubs, learning on your own about topics that interest you, listening to some technical lectures on YouTube/Coursera/ EdX, trying out some concepts, learning some programming language on your own, teaching students who are facing challenges in their courses (teaching, it is well known and established, is the most effective way to learn\u2014 teaching to someone else truly clarifies the topic in one\u2019s own mind) etc. | believe that those students who are ambitious and want to reach higher in life, developing this trait/ style is absolutely essential.", "133": "At lIIT-Delhi, the academic workload is on the heavier side. At the same time there are opportunities in the Institute and outside for pursuing non-academic interests, which are important to most students. Both these interests help in shaping up a good career.
