Nonetheless, there are many facilities and 22+clubs to grow in various ways. Students take part in a number of social and cultural activities. If they want to pursue a hobby, they just need to find some likeminded people to start their own club (if not already in existence) in the Institute. These clubs not only improve leadership skills but also help in building team spirit. Several student clubs in the institute enable students to enhance their talent in areas beyond academics. The clubs at IIIT- Delhi are based on adventure, music, software development, community work, dramatics, entrepreneurship, electronics, programming, game development, dance, painting, design, photography, chess, quizzing, sightseeing, public speaking, eco-development and more. These clubs enable students to share knowledge and mentor those looking to break into the field. These clubs not only hone their leadership skills but also help instil team spirit in them. Last year; student bodies organized as many as 105 events. Several student clubs in the institute enable them to enhance their talent in areas beyond academics. Clubs already in existence at IIIT Delhi are Quiz Club - Trivialis, Machaan, Astronauts, Design Club - Ink, Dance Club - MadToes, Byld, Women in Tech(WiT), Music Club Audio Bytes, Photography Club - Tasveer, the Literary Club, Eco Club and Computer Security club, FooBar, E-cell, Muse, Math club and many more. These clubs enable students to come together, share knowledge and mentor those looking to enter into the field. Students can also suggest books for the library, organize a blood donation campaign, an adventure trip during summer holidays or purchase a new instrument for the music room. In 2018-19 over 400 students participated in sports activities, 200 in cultural activities, 50 in quiz contests, and 400 in technical events. Students are also encouraged to help the society in some way or the other. Almost every student is involved with various NGOs all over the country.

Select electives that strengthen your ability for problem solving and make you learn new techniques and technologies and apply them. So, courses with programming assignments and/or projects are helpful including “conceptual” courses like advanced algorithms, optimization, etc.). In addition, ECE students should try to participate in labs/engineering design/ hardware design related projects to have a good hands-on experience. Instead of a minimum of two electives per semester, do three CSE/ECE/Mathematics/DES/SS electives(applicable to your respective branch) in your 3 and 4 years. Doan IP and BTP in engineering category.

This practice | am calling weekly sync-up (even though students might be practicing this over somewhat longer periods.) Some revise regularly, some do revision with the assignment, some during the weekends, etc., but one common theme is that they sync-up regularly and ensure that they are not behind or lost, as they realize that if they continue while being lost, they will not recover.(One student said that if he could not follow two lectures well, it was a big warning sign and he would put extra work to catch up). This practice ensures that even if they missed a lecture/assignment, they make up for it and do not fall behind. Without this practice, there is a real risk that a student can fall behind so much that it will be very hard to catch up. Ina semester of 4 months with a student doing 5 courses, one simply can’t really afford to fall behind too much! This can be viewed as the LAW for effective studying. Follow the LAW, with suitable enhancements/ modifications to suit your style, and the chances are that you will become an effective learner, and derive the benefits that come from that.\n",
