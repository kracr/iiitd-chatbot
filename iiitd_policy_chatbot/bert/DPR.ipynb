The SGPA is given for each semester and is computed using the following formula. The SGPA (u1.w1 + u2.w2 +  + un.wn)  or  (u1 + u2 +  + un) where ui is the number of credits for the course i and wi is the points earned through the letter grade in that course, and n is the number of courses taken in the semester. While doing the computation of SGPA, the course or thesis credits with grades S and X are ignored. \n"
