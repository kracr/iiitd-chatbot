      "365 First clarification most of jobs will still tap on technical strength of student to provide consultancy or solutions and though jobs may require more diverse skills also. Problem solving skills will still be highly valued. Assessment for such jobs will often be with respect to your program and and other general skills like team work and communication etc. other skills needed for consultancy etc and are likely to be taught on job.\n",

      "367 Effective Study Habits\n",
      "368 Most students want to do well in Most students studies Most students want to learn and get good grades or marks and and do well in opportunities that good education can provide. In College life and besides studies and self growth is also important goal for students. Therefore students need to effectively balance two goals and which often conflict. In this pursuit and effective study habits can be very useful. effective study habits can help to learn effectively and efficiently and thus leaving sufficient time for other activities in life without compromising your academics. However and we have realized that many students are not clear on how to study effectively.\n",
      "369 There is literature on this subject available indeed there is full book on this subject (multiple copies of which are in IIIT-D library). However and students often think these are too idealized or impractical and or that students do not apply to students environment or situation.\n",
      "370 To better understand what works well in environment like that of IIIT-Delhi and one of our graduating students (Digvijay Singh) interacted with set of students from our graduating students (Digvijay Singh) batch who were known to have good understanding of various subjects and who we will refer to as effective students (this set of students we determined not by grades but by their performance in interviews and exams conducted by best companies that visited we and general input from faculty and students about their understanding and knowledge and skills.) we further validated outcome of this study by interacting with set of students of current batch who have been doing well. It should be noted that not of them are in high CGPA category many of them are below 8.0. It should be pointed out that this is not statistically and scientifically rigorous study. Also and habits mentioned here are common ones and which most effective students we talked to followed. It does not mean that these are only methods. However and I believe if these practices are sound and if students follow these and students can expect to be effective in students learning.\n",
      "371 The three main effective study practices that emerged are:\n",
      "372 Lectures\n",
      "373 Attending lectures regularly and taking notes in lectures and even if lectures are not very exciting or engaging and is practice most effective students followed. This makes sense and students who do not follow this in hope that they will make up for lectures they miss and generally do not end up making up and and soon find they lost with too much to catch up. And missing lectures can easily become habit and which is clearly to be avoided.\n",
      "374 52\n",
      "375 The two aspect of this practice are\n",
      "376 (i) attend lectures and\n",
      "377 (ii) make notes in lectures not copy what faculty is writing and but making notes in your own language. The second point is important copying from board or slide is passive act which does not help in learning and but making notes in your own words is active learning task and which engages student and helps in learning. Paying attention in lectures actually helps save time student is likely to take much more time to understand and learn topic by student or student and if student or student does not attend lecture and or is inattentive.\n",
      "378 Assignments\n",
      "379 Do assignments yourself most effective students did most of assignments themselves and even if it took most effective students more time or even if most effective students were not able to complete in time. While lectures introduce topics and concepts and real learning and skill building of student happens during assignments this is where students practices and tries to apply concept or method. So and without doing assignments yourself and there can be really no learning. It should be noticed that taking help (not copying) from friends in assignments is fine and particularly when one is stuck. Indeed taking and giving help in form of discussions and explanations and guiding is good way of learning.\n",
      "380 Weekly Revision or Sync-Up\n",
      "381 All effective students have some method of ensuring that All effective students have revised material covered in previous week or so and and that All effective students prepared for next week’s lectures and work. This practice I am calling weekly sync-up (even though students might be practicing this over somewhat longer periods.) Some revise regularly and some do revision with assignment and some during weekends and etc. and but one common theme is that Some sync-up regularly and ensure that Some are not behind or lost and as Some realize that if Some continue while being lost and Some will not recover. (One student said that if One student could not follow two lectures well and it was big warning sign and One student would put extra work to catch up.) This practice ensures that even if they missed lecture or assignment and they make up for it and do not fall behind. Without This practice and there is real risk that student can fall behind so much that it will be very hard to catch up and .... In semester of 4 months with student doing 5 courses and one simply can’t really afford to fall behind too much! This can be viewed as LAW for effective studying. Follow LAW and with suitable enhancements or modifications to suit your style and and chances are that you will become effective learner and and derive benefits that come from that.\n",
      "382 53\n",
      "383 There are some other practices which some effective students also used:\n",
      "384 Prioritising Work\n",
      "385 When there are many tasks from multiple courses and as well as from other activities and there will clashing deadlines. Prioritising will clearly be important in such situation to achieve most in limited time. As one student said: In such scenario and life becomes lot easier when you manually set down targets to be achieved by what deadline (which maybe before or same day as your submission deadlines). Use sticky notes as gentle reminders to yourself so you can use your time wisely when brunt of work is more.\n",
      "386 Group Study\n",
      "387 Many prefer individual study\n",
      "388 Group and Individual Projects\n",
      "389 As said by one student: While it is good to do projects in team to learn teamwork and leadership qualities and I used to push myself and sometimes go forth with individual projects. Undoubtedly and it takes more effort and time and but it boosted my confidence in my own abilities to handle projects single-handedly and made me more self-reliant and self-sufficient.\n",
      "390 Help other students\n",
      "391 Explaintothemas explaining helps other students\n",
      "392 understand better (my note: by discussing or clarifying you are helping your friend and but by providing your assignment to your friends for copying you are actually hurting other students\n",
      "393 as you are discouraging other students\n",
      "394 to learn and besides taking other students\n",
      "395 slippery slope of using unfair means.)\n",
      "396 54\n",
      "397 Take help from friends for understanding\n",
      "398 Most students indicated that face-to-face discussion with friends was first and most common approach Most students used for clarifying doubts or material. If this did not work then Most students will go to discussion forums and instructor.\n",
      "399 Academics gets first priority\n",
      "400 This is more value statement but was commonly echoed by most of students. While they engaged in other activities (most of they are quite active in clubs and events and etc. and they are clear that academics get highest priority\n",
      "401 Besides these practices and there is one attitude or trait I would like to highlight and which I have seen in many students who have done well in whatever they do after college education and that is curiosity and initiative to go beyond courses. Many effective students engage in some technical activities that Many effective students do which are not needed for Many effective students courses i.e. Many effective students take initiative to go beyond courses. Examples of these initiatives can be: participating in competitive programming and participating in technical clubs and learning on your own about topics that interest you and listening to some technical lectures on YouTube or Coursera or EdX and trying out some concepts and learning some programming language on your own and teaching students who are facing challenges in their courses (teaching and it is well known and established and is most effective way to learn teaching to someone else truly clarifies topic in one’s own mind) etc. I believe that those students who are ambitious and want to reach higher in life and developing this trait or style is absolutely essential.\n",
      "402 I hope students will devise students own methods for being effective students using LAW and and going beyond. I hope this little study will be helpful to students in devising students own strategies.\n",
      "403 55\n",
      "404 Time Management\n",
      "405 At IIIT-Delhi and academic work load is on heavier side. At same time there are opportunities in Institute and outside for pursuing non-academic interests and which are important to most students. Both non-academic interests and which are important to most students help in shaping up good career. It is important to learn how to balance non-academic interests and which are important to most students such that we students can pursue our non-academic interests without hurting our academics. This note discusses this it is written by some graduating students from IIIT-Delhi and based on their experience at IIIT-Delhi in four years their were here.\n",
      "406 Prioritizing\n",
      "407 When it’s about balancing academic and non academic interests and it comes down to being good time manager. There is lot more time with us than us think even if us take out 12 hours for sleeping and food and commuting and etc and us still have 12 hours left every day and which is 84 hours per week. The problem is us may not be making best use of The problem. Prioritizing is very important. First and foremost and we need to put we priorities right. we need to see what is important to we in short and long term and devote time accordingly. There is no point in devoting lot of time on things that don’t mean much. Prioritizing comes easily when based on what we want to do but hard part is prioritizing on basis of what we ought to do. The crack lies in realizing difference. we should try and finish off tasks that are more important first. A simple example would be; spending some time to do we assignment before writing email for club activity and and after doing both and should hanging out and spending some time with friends come.\n",
      "408 Plan\n",
      "409 Take care of minutes and hours will take care of you.\n",
      "410 Rather than using clich: We should not waste time and We should rather use: We should judiciously use time. It is as simple as that. we should make good use of time. We have some interests that are intensive on We mind and body and then there are some that are relaxing. We should plan We day and week so that they are nicely Interleaved to ensure that We are in good state mentally and physically at times. This will massively boost We efficiency and We all’ll be able to work as well as enjoy lot more. Using productivity system like Kanban and GTD and Pomodoro or Kaizen and for managing time and tasks and could also be very helpful. Applications and tools that support these systems are available.\n",
      "411 56\n",
      "412 Applying Applications and tools that support these systems in We day to day works is good idea. Also and everyone has everyone own interesting ways of managing time and so we need to spend time to find we own fix and figure out what works best for we.\n",
      "413 Self Belief\n",
      "414 Last but not least; we need to believe we can manage well. We shouldn’t just get so much stuck up in planning and time management that everything starts ending there. It’s good to have plan and but plan must be flexible and we should be ready for challenges. If only thing that we take away out of we B.Tech is to manage we time efficiently and we’ll be success no matter what\n",
      "415 How much effort should I put?\n",
      "416 Give time to academics as per Institute’s guidelines which say 10 hours outside class per course per week. We should consider We non academic interest as 6th course and schedule 6th course 10 hrs too. Planning and managing 60 hrs in week out of 84 is doable. Keeping up to it and following it religiously is challenge.\n",
      "417 Give academics at least 3 hours day exclusive of classes. The key is to find 3 hours day such that we are purely studying in those 3 hours. No distractions at all. That way we will have minimum 5 hours day for everything else apart from food breaks and classes. we may utilize 2 hours out of those for relaxing and hanging around and socializing and we will still be left with 3 more hours. we may utilize those 3 hours to do something that we love.\n",
      "418 B.Tech is not My Cup of Tea\n",
      "419 First of and it is very normal and there is nothing to panic. However it is important to understand depth and authenticity of feeling and don’t give too much importance to feeling right away. Taking break from coursework for day or two may work. You should not run yourselves into ground. It’s important to realize that B.Tech is not end in B.Tech. Our life goal is not to do B.Tech. There is always bigger picture. The earlier Our understand better it is. You need to look at that bigger picture (your dreams and aspirations) and analyze for yourselves how important or not so important B.Tech is in getting there. Is it worth time and effort that you are putting in? Maybe you are trying too hard. You may go little easy for while.\n",
      "420 57\n",
      "421 Another very important thing is to know what is your cup of tea if it is not B.Tech? Do you know it? Maybe you can spend some time finding out that. The most amazing thing here at IIIT-Delhi is innovative approach in air. You have idea; you can talk to professor and do something about idea. You are not finding regular courses interesting enough; you can take up Independent Studies and Independent Projects. That’s beauty here.\n",
      "422 I will quote my personal example here. I don’t know where I will land up five year down line and and unfortunately B.Tech doesn’t seem to fascinate me way I thought it would. So and I thought and okay and let me try and explore interesting areas and find out. One of areas that I found interesting was Sports Engineering. I have passion for sports and I am doing Engineering and so passion for sports’s worth giving shot. So I went to professor and took up Independent Study to understand Sports Engineering. professor supported idea and idea turned out well for professor.\n",
      "423 The point is and it is okay to have feeling and doubts about B.Tech and but they should not use idea as excuse to crib about situation. You should always put in effort and think beyond. Yes and picture is indeed much larger than B.Tech degree. Engineering can be applied in spheres of life. It depends on you. It is you to define and you to apply.\n",
      "424 If coping with course is getting too hard?\n",
      "425 What do you do if you are not able to handle courses properly perhaps due to lack of time or other interests and or simply because you take more time for topic?\n",
      "426 Assume 10 hours for course are more than enough. Complete assignments soon and pay attention in classes and assignments won’t feel burden. Make sure you are at your attentive best most of time. This can come with following good schedules and taking breaks when your concentration starts to dwindle. This will help you finish tasks faster and give you more time for pending tasks.\n",
      "427 Prioritizing can help identify courses that are important for you and and those that are less important. Ensure that more important ones get good effort and while less important ones get at least sufficient effort for you to pass.\n",
      "428 Do some credits in summer whenever opportunity arises. This will allow you to reduce your courses to 4 per semester and at least in final years.\n",
      "429 Just keep trying and and you’ll start loving work load.\n",
      "430 Manage time and crib about work load. Study effectively in end.\n",
      "431 58\n",
      "432 Advice for difficult core-courses\n",
      "433 There is no point in running away from them unless you’re fine with poor grade (and little to no learning in core CSE or ECE area). You’ve got to put in time and effort on anything that you believe is worthwhile and but difficult. There are plenty of resources available online. Personally and most students have found most students very helpful. Then and make sure you give assignments your best (and honest) shot. It can’t be stressed how important this is. Outside of classroom and this is where most of learning will happen. Discussing problems with your peers and TAs is immensely helpful too. Tutorials are good place to hold such discussions. However and make sure you’re not cheating by copying from anyone or anywhere.\n",
      "434 It about putting in quality time on subject. The initial learning curve can be steep at times and but you have got to make it simply because it is so very important. There is reason why these have been made core-courses.\n",
      "435 Attend classes. Use office hours effectively and bug professors till time concept is clear to you.\n",
      "436 Read text book for course. professors are beautiful and very helpful. Moreover attend classes and stay up to date and code regularly. Coding is something that will open up your logics and will take you through courses like ADA and DSA.\n",
      "437 Also and these courses are important for placements. Instead of being focused on just scoring good grades and try to get good knowledge of these topics. There are many topics of these subjects which are not covered during course. Explore and learn them yourself instead of relying on just course material.\n",
      "438 59\n",
      "439 Facing difficulties in particular course?\n",
      "440 Try some alternate resources - online video lectures and some other notes or books. It can often happen that you are just not very receptive to how course is being taught. A change can often trigger interest and understanding. You need to find what is best for you. Secondly and seek advice from your seniors. Many of advice might have gone through same phase and would be able to offer insights.\n",
      "441 Nothing is difficult until you put your efforts. TAs and instructors and seniors are always ready to help. Self study is must. Talk to professor and TAs and instructors and seniors help always.\n",
      "442 What Should I Do in First year and to Do Well in Subsequent Years?\n",
      "443 Start off to develop your basics well and keep improving. Courses like Introduction to Programming and DSA and Probability and and Algebra need better and fine understanding since other courses are based on other courses. The sooner you realize and try to accomplish this and more this would help.\n",
      "444 Make sure that programming becomes second nature to you. You can not spend 2 or 3 years learning how to code. If you do spend more than year and you will end up missing out on other things that are being taught because your time will go in dealing with programming issues. Practice as much as you can. You need to get to stage where you can easily translate your thoughts into code. You don’t need to target tough algorithmic problems.\n",
      "445 60\n",
      "446 Target problems for which you know solution - sorting and searching and and traversals. You need to acquire ability to effortlessly write code for solution that you know. You will quickly realize that most of time and you’ll have to write code for known (and already solved) problems rather than coming up with new solution by yourself. Once you are good with programming and you’ll be able to do well in lot of areas in latter years of your B.Tech.\n",
